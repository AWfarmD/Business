#### Business Project Proposal ####

**Problem/Purpose**

Customers are upset when they purchase bad products due to fake reviews on Amazon, and may potentially stop using the site due to lost trust.  Having a system that is able to detect fake reviews can help delete them and allow members continue to shop at the site with confidence.

**Data Description**

* I plan to use the Amazon review data from this website, https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html#subsets, and columns are overall rating, verified (emailed the author to clarify if this means the reviewer made a verifed purchase if the value is True), review time, reviewer ID, Amazon standard identification number (specific number for each product), style, reviewer name, review text, summary, vote (helpful votes of the reivew).
* A sample analysis in this project is positive/native review ratio per reviewer with 4-5 overall rating as positive reviews and 1-3 as negative reviews.  This is used to see if a reviewer is posting way more positive reivews than negative reviews, and may potentially be posting fake reviews.

**Tools**

* Google Sheets for EDA
* Tableau for visualization

**MVP Goal**

A minimum viable product could be a bar graph showing the number of reviews done by certain users which help us to visualize if certain users write an excessive amount of reviews that could potentially be fake reviews.
